# Alerting Principles

## Goals
Alerts exist to:
- Notify humans of actionable problems
- Protect user experience
- Reduce mean time to recovery (MTTR)

## What Should Alert
- User-facing impact
- Imminent risk of outage
- Error budget burn

## What Should NOT Alert
- Transient spikes
- Symptoms without action
- Metrics without clear ownership

## Alert Quality
Good alerts are:
- Actionable
- Specific
- Rare

Bad alerts cause fatigue and reduce trust.
